# Setup

## The usual

As always:

1. Clone the lab repository to your computer
1. Open the lab repository in VS Code
1. Open the Julia REPL and activate, then instantiate, the lab environment
1. Make sure you can render: `quarto render template.qmd` in the terminal.
    - If you run into issues, try running `] build IJulia` in the Julia REPL (`]` enters the package manager).
    - If you still have issues, try opening up `blankfile.py`. That should trigger VS Code to give you the option to install the Python extension, which you should do. Then you should be able to open a menu in the bottom right of your screen to select which Python installation you want VS Code to use.


## Load packages

```{julia}
using CSV
using DataFrames
using DataFramesMeta
using Distributions
using Plots
using StatsPlots
using Unitful

Plots.default(; margin=5Plots.mm)
```

## Local package

```{julia}
using Revise
using HouseElevation
```

## House

This creates the House object which contains all fo the relevant information four our building, including: depth-damage function, area, cost (USD), elevation relative to gauge, and metadata
```{julia}
house = let
    haz_fl_dept = CSV.read("data/haz_fl_dept.csv", DataFrame) # read in the file
    desc = "Cafeteria Restaurant, structure"
    row = @rsubset(haz_fl_dept, :Description == desc)[1, :] # select the row I want
    area = 4004u"ft^2"
    height_above_gauge = 3.74u"ft"
    House(
        row;
        area=area,
        height_above_gauge=height_above_gauge,
        value_usd=400_000,
    )
end
```

## Sea-level Rise

Here we will model sea-level rise using the approach by Otto et al. (2017) that is calibrated to hisotrical sea-level rise in the Netherlands.
```{julia}
slr_scenarios = let
    df = CSV.read("data/slr_oddo.csv", DataFrame)
    [Oddo17SLR(a, b, c, tstar, cstar) for (a, b, c, tstar, cstar) in eachrow(df)]
end
println("There are $(length(slr_scenarios)) parameter sets")
```

## Storm Surge

Here we are modeling a distribution for storm surge by sampling parameteres from the range centered in the distribution from Lab 3. This helps to account for the uncertainty in storm surge. We can call this function to get different distributions for storm surge.
```{julia}
function draw_surge_distribution()
    μ = rand(Normal(5, 1))
    σ = rand(Exponential(1.5))
    ξ = rand(Normal(0.1, 0.05))
    GeneralizedExtremeValue(μ, σ, ξ)
end
```

## Discount Rate

The discount rate is important in NPV analysis, but there are both random and not random factors that go into discounting, which are acounted for in the following function.
```{julia}
function draw_discount_rate()
    return rand(Normal(0.04, 0.02))
end
```

## Running the Simulation

We are adding the object ModelParams, which contains all fo the parameters of the model that dont change from one simulation to the next.
```{julia}
p = ModelParams(
    house=house,
    years=2024:2100
)
```
